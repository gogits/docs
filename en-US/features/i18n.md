# Localize Gogs

Gogs introduced support for multiple languages in release `v0.5.0`.

To enable this support, edit `custom/conf/app.ini` (enabled all by default):

```ini
[i18n]
LANGS = en-US,zh-CN,zh-HK,de-DE,fr-FR,nl-NL,lv-LV,ru-RU,ja-JP,es-ES,pt-BR,pl-PL,bg-BG,it-IT
NAMES = English,简体中文,繁體中文,Deutsch,Français,Nederlands,Latviešu,Русский,日本語,Español,Português do Brasil,Polski,български,Italiano
```

## Contribute Translation

Sign up for an account on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gogs) and fill untranslated strings.

Sometimes, you will find it's quite hard to translate a sentence from English to your language; do not panic! An exact translation from English is not required, just convey the idea.

In case you want to test your translation and avoid make changes in Git history, you can put your locale file into `custom/conf/locale/<file>` and restart Gogs.

### Make Corrections

If you found an incorrect translation string, to search on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gogs), you need to type the key name into the search box.

For example, suppose you think `Home` is a wrong translation, do not search `Home`, instead, search for its key name `home`. Similarly, search something like `home:uname_holder` for keys under this section.

## Custom Locale Files

If you're not satisfied with official locale translation, you can modify those fields with another file in `custom/conf/locale/locale_<lang>.ini`, and then restart Gogs.
